    <a href="javascript:void(null);" class="faq-contact-button">
      Contact Support
    </a>
  </div>
</FAQSection>

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | `'Frequently asked questions'` | Main heading for the FAQ section |
| `tagline` | `string` | `'FAQ'` | Small tagline above the title |
| `description` | `string` | Default description | Descriptive text below the title |
| `faqs` | `FAQItem[]` | `[]` | Array of FAQ objects |
| `variant` | `'default' \| 'bordered' \| 'minimal'` | `'default'` | Visual style variant |
| `className` | `string` | `''` | Additional CSS classes |

## FAQItem Interface

```typescript
interface FAQItem {
  question: string;  // The question text (required)
  answer: string;    // The answer text (required)
  id?: string;       // Optional unique identifier
}
```

## Visual Variants

### Default Variant
Clean card-based design with subtle shadows and borders:

```tsx
<FAQSection variant="default" faqs={faqs} />
```

### Bordered Variant
Minimal design with borders but no background fill:

```tsx
<FAQSection variant="bordered" faqs={faqs} />
```

### Minimal Variant
Ultra-clean design with just bottom borders:

```tsx
<FAQSection variant="minimal" faqs={faqs} />
```

## Individual Accordion Behavior

Each FAQ item creates its own independent accordion component with the following features:

- **Individual Control**: Each accordion operates independently
- **Smooth Animations**: Built-in expand/collapse animations
- **Keyboard Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **Unique IDs**: Optional custom IDs for each FAQ item

```tsx
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "Follow our quick start guide...",
    id: "getting-started" // Optional custom ID
  }
];

<FAQSection faqs={faqs} />
```

## Underlying Accordion Components

The FAQSection uses the updated Accordion architecture:

- **Accordion Component**: Each FAQ creates an individual `<Accordion>` with a required `label` prop
- **AccordionContent Component**: Each answer is wrapped in `<AccordionContent>` for proper styling
- **Independent Operation**: Each accordion operates separately (no global state management)

### Direct Accordion Usage

You can also use the Accordion components directly for more control:

```tsx
import Accordion from "@/components/block/Accordion.astro"
import AccordionContent from "@/components/block/AccordionContent.astro"

<Accordion label="Custom Question" variant="bordered">
  <AccordionContent>
    <p>Your custom answer with <strong>rich formatting</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lists are supported</li>
      <li>Links work too: <a href="/docs">Documentation</a></li>
    </ul>
  </AccordionContent>
</Accordion>
```

### Accordion Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `label` | `string` | Required | The accordion header text |
| `variant` | `'default' \| 'bordered' \| 'minimal'` | `'default'` | Visual style variant |
| `className` | `string` | `''` | Additional CSS classes |
| `id` | `string` | Auto-generated | Unique identifier |
| `defaultExpanded` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to start expanded |

## Custom Content

Use the slot to add additional content like contact information or CTAs:

```tsx
<FAQSection title="Common Questions" faqs={faqs}>
  <div class="faq-contact">
    <h3>Need more help?</h3>
    <p>Our support team is available 24/7 to assist you.</p>
    <a href="/support" class="faq-contact-button">
      Get Support
    </a>
  </div>
</FAQSection>
```

  --faq-transition: 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Custom Styling

<FAQSection 
  className="custom-faq"

>

    .custom-faq .faq-question {
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
</FAQSection>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Question Writing**: Use clear, specific questions that users actually ask
2. **Answer Length**: Keep answers concise but complete (2-4 sentences ideal)
3. **Organization**: Group related questions together
4. **Search Integration**: Consider adding search functionality for many FAQs
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep content current and add new questions based on user feedback

## Common Use Cases

- **Product Documentation**: Feature explanations and troubleshooting
- **Support Pages**: Customer service and technical support
- **Onboarding**: New user questions and getting started guides
- **Pricing Pages**: Billing, plans, and feature questions
- **Legal Pages**: Terms, privacy, and compliance questions

## Integration with Search

For sites with many FAQs, consider adding search functionality:

```tsx
<!-- Add search before FAQ section -->
<div class="faq-search">
  <input type="search" placeholder="Search FAQs..." />
</div>

<FAQSection faqs={filteredFaqs} />
```

## Analytics and Optimization

Track which questions are most frequently opened to:
- Identify common user pain points
- Optimize question ordering
- Create additional documentation for popular topics
- Improve product features based on common questions

## Content Management

### Static Content
```tsx
const faqs = [
  { question: "...", answer: "..." },
  // ... more FAQs
];
```

### Dynamic Content
```tsx
// Fetch from CMS or API
const faqs = await fetch('/api/faqs').then(res => res.json());
```

### Markdown Support
```tsx
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I format code?",
    answer: "Use backticks for `inline code` or triple backticks for code blocks."
  }
];
```
