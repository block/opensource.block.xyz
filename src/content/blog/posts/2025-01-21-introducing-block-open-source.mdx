Today, we're excited to announce the official launch of Block's Open Source Program Office (OSPO). This marks a significant milestone in our journey as an open source company and reflects our commitment to giving back to the communities that power our technology.

## Why an OSPO?

Block has always been a heavy user of open source software. From our mobile apps built with Kotlin and Swift to our backend services running on Linux, open source is fundamental to everything we build.

But using open source isn't enough. We believe companies that benefit from open source have a responsibility to contribute back—not just code, but also time, resources, and leadership.

The OSPO formalizes that commitment. It's our way of ensuring that open source isn't just something we do occasionally, but a core part of how we operate.

## What the OSPO Does

Our Open Source Program Office has several key responsibilities:

### Strategy and Governance

We help teams across Block make informed decisions about open source:

- When to open source a project
- Which license to choose
- How to build and maintain communities
- How to measure success

### Community Engagement

We facilitate Block's participation in open source communities:

- Supporting employees who contribute to external projects
- Building relationships with foundations and other organizations
- Organizing events and sponsorships
- Representing Block in open source discussions

### Project Support

We provide resources and expertise to Block's open source projects:

- Infrastructure and tooling
- Documentation and marketing
- Community management
- Security and compliance

### Education and Advocacy

We help Block engineers become better open source citizens:

- Training on open source best practices
- Guidelines for contributing to external projects
- Resources for starting new open source projects
- Internal advocacy for open source values

## Our Open Source Philosophy

The OSPO is guided by several core principles:

### Community First

Successful open source projects are built on healthy communities. We prioritize community building over feature development, and we measure success by the strength and diversity of our contributor base.

### Transparency

We believe in working in the open. Our development happens in public repositories, our roadmaps are shared openly, and our decision-making processes are transparent.

### Sustainability

Open source maintainers shouldn't burn out. We're committed to sustainable practices that support long-term project health, including:

- Adequate resourcing for maintenance
- Clear governance structures
- Succession planning
- Support for maintainer well-being

### Collaboration

We're better together. We actively seek partnerships with other companies, foundations, and communities to advance shared goals.

## Our Open Source Portfolio

Block maintains dozens of open source projects across various domains:

### Mobile Development
