Block is proud to announce that we are joining the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as a sponsor and launching a new Open Source Public Policy Lab. These initiatives represent our continued commitment to advancing open source ecosystems through collaboration, policy development, and community engagement.

## Joining the Open Source Initiative

The Open Source Initiative has been the steward of the Open Source Definition for over 25 years, providing critical infrastructure for the open source movement. As a sponsor, Block will support OSI's mission to promote and protect open source software development, distribution, and use.

Our sponsorship reflects our belief that strong institutions are essential for the health and growth of open source ecosystems. By supporting OSI, we're investing in the governance structures and community processes that make open source collaboration possible at scale.

## Launching the Open Source Public Policy Lab

Today, we're also announcing the creation of Block's Open Source Public Policy Lab. This initiative will focus on four key areas:

### Governance
We'll explore and develop frameworks for open source project governance that balance community participation with effective decision-making. This includes examining different governance models, contributor agreements, and community structures.

### Licensing
The lab will contribute to ongoing discussions about open source licensing, including emerging challenges around AI, cloud services, and new technology paradigms. We'll work to ensure licensing frameworks remain relevant and effective.

### Incentives
We'll research and promote sustainable models for open source development, including funding mechanisms, contributor recognition, and economic incentives that support long-term project health.

### Cybersecurity
The lab will address security challenges in open source software, including supply chain security, vulnerability disclosure, and security tooling. We'll work to make open source software more secure by default.

## Why This Matters

Open source software powers the modern economy, but it faces significant challenges around sustainability, security, and governance. These challenges require thoughtful policy development and cross-sector collaboration.

Through the Public Policy Lab, we'll bring together researchers, policymakers, developers, and industry leaders to develop practical solutions to these challenges. Our goal is to create resources and frameworks that benefit the entire open source ecosystem.

## Building on Our Open Source Foundation

This announcement builds on Block's existing open source commitments:

- Our [Open Source Program Office](https://block.xyz/open-source) coordinates our open source strategy and community engagement
- We're founding members of the [Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA)](https://www.opencrypto.org/about/)
- We've joined the [Kotlin Foundation](https://block.xyz/inside/block-joins-the-kotlin-foundation)
- We maintain numerous open source projects, including [goose](https://github.com/block/goose), our AI agent framework

## Get Involved

We believe the best policy development happens through open collaboration. The Public Policy Lab will operate transparently, with opportunities for community input and participation.

If you're interested in contributing to the lab's work or have ideas for policy challenges we should address, we'd love to hear from you. Visit [block.xyz/open-source](https://block.xyz/open-source) to learn more and get involved.

Together, we can build policy frameworks that support thriving, sustainable open source ecosystems for decades to come.
